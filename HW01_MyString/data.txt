Not only does this seem  reasonable to me, but I maintain that it is what every
wise man ought to say in similar circumstances; that he ought to banish to a
great distance the missionary who wants to instruct and baptise him all of a
sudden before the 	evidence is verified. Now I maintain that there is no
revelation against which these or   similar objections cannot be made, and with
more force than against Christianity. Hence it follows that if there is but one
true religion and if every man is 	bound to  follow it under pain of damnation,
he must   spend his whole life in studying, testing, comparing all these
religions, in travelling through	the countries in which they are
established. No man is free from a man’s first duty; no one has a right to
depend on another’s judgment. The artisan who earns his bread by his daily
toil, the ploughboy 	who cannot read, the delicate and timid maiden, the
invalid who can scarcely leave his 	bed, all  without exception must study,consider, argue, travel over the whole world; there will be no more fixed and settled nations; the whole   earth will swarm with pilgrims on their way, at great cost of time and trouble, to verify, compare, and examine
for themselves the various religions to be found. Then farewell to the
trades,the arts, the sciences of mankind, farewell to all peaceful  occupations;there can be no study but     that of religion, even 	the strongest, the most industrious, the most intelligent, the oldest, will hardly be able in his 	last years to know where he is; and it will be a  wonder if he manages to  find out what religion he ought to live by, before the hour of his death.
